Hello, I am YU Runbo, a sophomore undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK). My current research interests lie in __Trustworthy Machine Learning__, with a particular focus on __designing differentially private mechanisms in machine learning to defend against adversarial attacks, such as membership inference attacks__.

I am fortunate to be mentored by [Chen Liu](https://liuchen1993.cn/HomePage/index.html) at CityU, who has kindly provided me with the opportunity to embark on my research journey. I am also deeply grateful for the guidance and support from the senior members of our research group.

I am keenly interested in applying for a research internship during the summer of 2025.
